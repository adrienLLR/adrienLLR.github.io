          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Graduated from ENSIMAG computer science school, I have studied Machine Learning, Statistics, Algorithmics and Data Structures, Software Conception. </p>
            My biggest work experience so far was my internship at Nationale Nederlanden where I developed an end-to-end topic modeling solution to extract valuable insights from audio calls 
            of Clients, Brokers, Banks. An application was done on Streamlit for an intuitive experience for the users to navigate through the data and generate insights. 
            The application is now used in production, and thanks to it,
            the company's all center is better prepared, frequently raised issues are fixed more quickly, services and products are more aligned with what the customers need.  </p>
            I am open to positions regarding Data Science/Software Engineering field.</p>
