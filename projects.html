          <h3>Sub-language of Java Compiler</h3>
          <p> Homemade compiler for a homemade language called Deca which is a sub language of Java.
              The compiler is coded in Java and the assembly language is that of a homemade abstract machine
              called Ima. Use of ANTLR to do the lexical and syntactic analysis and to help build
              the abstract tree. <br>
              It was a group project, I focused on the tree decoration, helped on the assembly language generation
              and I conducted the extension part which was to implement a linker to be able to generate and link 
              object files.

          <p>A graphical user interface library coded in C that allows a user to create their own graphical window using different widgets such as frames, buttons, toplevel, etc. Each widget can be bound to a callback function that can perform various types of applications. This library was developed in a modular way to allow for the addition of other widgets.</p>
