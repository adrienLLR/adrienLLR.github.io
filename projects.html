          <h3>Headline generation</h3>

          <p>Construction of a Seq2Seq model that takes news bodies texts and generate their titles. The task is Text Summatization.
            Encoder and Decoder are LSTMs, embedding is done with Word2Vec and training with Teacher Forcing algorithm. Inference is then
            done with Greedy Decoding.

          <h3>Random Act Of Pizza Classification</h3>

          <p>Classification on a dataset containing text and numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis. Use of TF-IDF and NMF to extract relevant topics.
            Feature engineering comprising text features embedding into vectors thanks to wiki-words World2Vec model ( skipgram version ),
            narrative and time features addition. Use of Normalization, PCA, Cross Validation. Comparison between different models :
            Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors. Evaluation performed with ROC AUC, accuracy and 
            confusion matrix.

          <h3>Bayesian Neural Network</h3>

          <p>Implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network using the Bayes By Backprop algorithm proposed by the paper
            "Weight Uncertainty in Neural Network". Everything was done with only numpy. Use of Variational Inference method,
            Adam optimizer, Gradient Descent, Statistic.

          <p>Making of an artificial intelligence capable of playing blobwar thanks to 
            min-max algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening along with other
            optimizations. Without iterative deepening, the AI can play 8 moves ahead in a
            reasonable amount of time.

          <h3>Java's custom language compiler</h3>
          <p> Homemade compiler for a homemade language called Deca which is a sub language of Java.
              The compiler is coded in Java and the assembly language is that of a homemade abstract machine
              called Ima. Use of ANTLR to do the lexical and syntactic analysis and to help build
              the abstract tree.
              It was a group project, I focused on the tree decoration, helped on the assembly language generation
              and I conducted the extension part which was to implement a linker to be able to generate and link 
              object files.

          <p>A graphical user interface library coded in C that allows a user to create their own graphical window using different widgets such as frames, buttons, toplevel, etc. Each widget can be bound to a callback function that can perform various types of applications. This library was developed in a modular way to allow for the addition of other widgets.</p>
