        <h3>Sub-language of Java Compiler</h3>
        <!-- <img src="sneakpeek1.png" width="400" height="500" alt="No images available because of policy"> -->
        <p> Homemade compiler for a homemade language called Deca which is a sub language of Java.
            The compiler is coded in Java and the assembly language is that of a homemade abstract machine
            called Ima. Use of ANTLR to do the lexical and syntactic analysis and to help build
            the abstract tree. <br>
            It was a group project, I focused on the tree decoration, helped on the assembly language generation
            and I conducted the extension part which was to implement a linker to be able to generate and link 
            object files.

        <p>A graphical user interface library coded in C that allows a user to create their own graphical window using different widgets such as frames, buttons, toplevel, etc. Each widget can be bound to a callback function that can perform various types of applications. This library was developed in a modular way to allow for the addition of other widgets.</p>

        <p> Conception of a simplified version of the Risc-V processor in VHDL with Vivado for testing. <br>
            Making of the decoding of the instructions, interruptions handling and jumping handling while
            most of the operative part was already done.
